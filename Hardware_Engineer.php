							<h2>Skills required</h2>
							<p style="font-size:16px;">Aspiring hardware engineers must have a solid foundation in mathematics, science, and computer science. Additionally, they should possess strong communication skills to effectively convey instructions both verbally and in writing. Other essential skills include:</p>
							
							<ol style="font-size:16px;">
                                <li><b>1. Teamwork - </b>designing a product involves collaborating with other relevant parties, such as software engineers</li>
                                <li><b>2. Creativity – </b>thinking outside the box results in innovative designs and novel solutions to problems</li>
                                <li><b>3. Problem-solving skills – </b>the ability to approach complex issues with curiosity and determination rather than frustration serves hardware engineers well</li>
                                <li><b>4. Analytic thinking – </b>logically examining the steps taken and the outcome helps hardware engineers make corrections and produce better results</li>
                                <li><b>5. Multitasking – </b>hardware engineers may work on different projects simultaneously and need to be aware of competing deadlines and priorities</li>
